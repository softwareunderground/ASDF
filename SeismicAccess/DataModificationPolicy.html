<h2 id="toc_0.1">Modification policy</h2>

<p>
When supporting modifications to existing objects, we should provide a few services that are really useful in today's age of concurrent work:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Modifications can be stored 'as such', only to be applied when a 'commit' is requested

<li>
Multiple modification access should either be prevented or at least made known to the attempter

</ul>
