<h2 id="toc_0.1">Output adapters</h2>

<p>
Output adapters enable writing data to a target data store or file.
</p>

<p>
It is essential to support writing to SEG-Y file. What we do not want is support writing to sub-standard files, i.e. Revision 0. Revision 1 files can now be read by almost all packages. Revision 2 may also be a target in the future although many 'improvements' for Rev. 2 are questionable at best.
</p>

<p>
We expect the 'internal' format to be flat-file based, not a special-purpose datastore:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Databases are inherently opaque

<li>
Data exchange usually requires yet another format

</ul>
