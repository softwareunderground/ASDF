<h2 id="toc_0.1">Core library design</h2>

<p>
When creating a toolkit, it is often tempting to cram as many features as possible into it. The problem with such an approach is that it makes it harder to use only the part of the toolkit that you are interested in. For this reason, the core library should be kept minimal. Even features that are deemed essential for the success of the project - like SEG-Y support - should not be in the core library. We may think about not even including the target data format in the core library.
