<h2 id="toc_0.1">Internationalization strategy</h2>

<p>
Language issues are a nightmare for those who want to focus on the technology. The fact of life is, though, that non-English languages are getting more important all the time, including in highly technical areas.
</p>

<p>
The solution is to prepare for internationalization. This will cost. But anyone who has ever retro-fitted internationalization will know, adding language support at a later stage is just extremely difficult, so difficult that it is often prohibitive. For that reason, it seems a good idea to immediately prepare for usgae in systems that use other lanaguages, and take the hit up front.
</p>

<p>
Once the infrastructure is in place, there should be a mechanism to create texts for other languages, and maintain those databases. Examples are error messages and documentation hooks.
