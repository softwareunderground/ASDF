<h2 id="toc_0.1">Access to the sampled data</h2>

<p>
Data access layers invariably offer different ways to access tha data. Usually, you declare an 'interest', so that the underlying system can optimize access. This seems a good, universally usable strategy.
</p>

<p>
Within that 'interest' two modes are essentail:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Iteration: just handle all data in a 'natural' order (determined by the system)

<li>
Random access: be able to inspect different parts as the situation requires

</ul>
<p>
For random access, an important requirement is to be able to jump according to alternate keys.
</p>

<p>
In terms of supported subselections, it seems most important are ranged subsets (subcubes, line parts) and polylines for random lines in 3D.
