<h2 id="toc_0.1">Versioning</h2>

<p>
Any project that produces software needs a system to manage versions. In particular, all source code needs to be managed by a code version management system.
</p>

<p>
For OS projects, there are really only two choices: git or svn. Luckily, it is possible to use both so anyone can use their favorite way to access the versioning system. The solution is GitHub.
