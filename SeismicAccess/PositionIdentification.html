<h2 id="toc_0.1">Handling of position identification</h2>


<p>
A major issue when handling old SEG-Y files is what defines the position of a trace. In 3D, you have inline/crossline versus (X,Y), the two are connected via what is called in Petrel a 'SpatialLattice'. In 2D, the situation is, in a way, even worse. There is no such consensus on trace identification like the inline/crossline in 3D. Therefore, to identify a trace you have to choose a 'Trace number'. The CDP number would be a good candidate, were it not that very often users do not even recognize the numbering.
</p>

<p>
In any case, trace positions need to be identified and coupled to a position in a coordinate system. Although the exact nature of the coordinate system is crucial to the user, it is not an issue of seismic data exchange as such. The only requirements are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A trace has a key which identifies its position. The key can consist of multiple numbers (for example inline <strong>and</strong> crossline).

<li>
That key will be coupled to an (X,Y) in a known coordinate system.

</ul>

<p>
For pre-stack data an extra field 'offset' enters the arena. It takes upon itself a bit of both roles: identification AND co-ordinate. To complete the positioning info the 'azimuth' would be required, but it's hardly ever available.
</p>

<p>
The general strategy to handle these issues is to make the keying mandatory and some form of positioning from that required. Any other per-trace info can be optional.
