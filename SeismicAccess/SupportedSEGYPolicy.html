<h2 id="toc_0.1">SEG-Y support</h2>

<p>
Data in the SEG-Y format is so ubiquitous that it needs a special place in our project plan. Companies and institutions simply have millions of SEG-Y files in data stores. The quality (from a data management point of view) of these files varies from very good (Well implemented Revision 1) to very bad (very proprietary variants, incomplete, violations of the standard, ...).
</p>

<p>
It is a good idea to be able to read as many variants as possible. Writing on the other hand, should be limited to stricly standards-compliant Revision 1 data. Even if the violation of the standard is widely used we should not support it.
