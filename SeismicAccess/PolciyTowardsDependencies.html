<h2 id="toc_0.1">Dependency policy</h2>

<p>
There is an eternal clash between programmers and software engineers: programmers want to use any tool they find useful. Software engineers are scared of external packages; they want to use as few external dependencies as possible.
</p>

<p>
We think the software engineer's vision is especially useful when it comes to general-putpose tools, where it is of essence that a legitimate claim can be made about 'runs always, anywhere'. Therefore, minimizing dependencies is a prime constraint.
