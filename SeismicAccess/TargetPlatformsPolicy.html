<h2 id="toc_0.1">Target platforms</h2>

<p>
It seems logical to support as many platforms as possible. This may however prove to be very 'costly' (think of RPMs for all Linux variants). Therefore, 'as many as possible' may translate into 'most important first'. Windows, Linux, then Mac. Android may actually become very important too, traditionally not an imprtant target, but Matt Hall's observations about power and penetration are likely to have a big impact in the near future.
