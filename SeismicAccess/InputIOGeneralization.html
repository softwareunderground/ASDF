<h2 id="toc_0.1">Input adapters</h2>

<p>
Input adapters make sure existing data can be delivered in a generalized way. They can read data from disk, or maybe obtain the data through the Internet from a remote data store.
</p>

<p>
As many legacy SEG-Y files exist we will have to make a SEG-Y adapter that support a wide range of SEG-Y flavors, even ones that violate the standard. Therefore, all SEG-Y revisions will have to be supported. The 'internal' format should go all-out to make data available as fast as possible in a wide range of usage settings.
