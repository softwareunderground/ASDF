<h2 id="toc_0.1">Cross-platform support and language</h2>

<p>
When making - esentially - a library to access data, it is essential to make it directly usable for programmers that use a variety of languages and platforms.
</p>

<p>
A promising idea is to use the Haxe language, which allows generation of libraries and interfaces for many highly-used languages like Java, C++ and Python. In that way most programmers can use the services directly in their native programming language.
